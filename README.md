## Hi there üëã

I'm Kevin, a multi-Discipline Software Engineering Architect with an esoteric background spanning 45 years of software development.   I've worked on most things from 4 & 8 bit microprocessor coding (micro code, machine code and assembler), mini computer and mainframe software development, personal computer software (windows, mac, linux), mobile development (wml, xhtml, iOS, Android, iPad OS), and Cloud Infrastructure, Micro Service and Software (AWS, GCP, Azure, VMWare, ProxMox).  Additionally I've worked in electrical and electronics engineering projects ranging from analog telephone circuits, pbx, video, radio (lf, AM, hf, FM, vhf and uhf), television (cctv, vhf and uhf), TTL, microcomputer and microcontroller circuitry design.

üî≠ Current research:

- a multi-year study into the practical and ethical application of AI tools for software & cloud infrastructure engineering.
- methods of making secure home and mobile/small office systems accessible to non-technical users.
- virtual distributed (both on and off cloud) infrastructure services for distributed teams and digital nomad scenarios; including distributed raid, virtual pbx & identity services.

‚öíÔ∏è Current projects:

- AI-Core Smart Home system, supporting both behind-the-firewall and in-the-wild LLM models, Apple Home, Home Assistant, User Content Libraries and more.
- Hardware for above, prototypes for Kiosk and Rack-Mount versions
- secure micro-infrastructure systems - tiny & small LAN (firewall, ad-block, affordable high-security wifi)
- desktop 10" rack system to host firewall, ad-block, intrusion countermeasure, NAS/Media Server, LLM host
